Altered list program

- When we assign one variable to another, we're not creating a duplicate; instead, we're assigning both variables to the same location in memory. So, if we modify one, the other will be affected as well. Understanding these concepts is crucial when writing programs and working with data in the computer's memory.

Variable                                          What is a Variable?

- A variable is a way of storing information in a computer program. Think of a variable like a container and the name of the variable as the label on the container which shows us what is inside. Variables are used in coding and programming to help coders understand, remember, and use the information in the program.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variable names traditionally begin with lowercase letters in Python.

Types of variables in Python

- Integers, which are whole numbers.

- Strings, which are collections of characters.
- Booleans, which are true or false values, are another type of variable in Python.
- floats, which are decimal numbers.
- complex numbers, which are used for complex mathematical calculations.

#Note: Your program reads your code from top to bottom, this means that if you have assigned your variables as the following 

Kopano = Creative 

Kopano = Artistic 

The code will read as Kopano = Artistic 

#Note: If you want to name a variable multiple names use _ so for example First_Name
